## There are a couple of factors that play a big role in a certain chemical's explosiveness, and the main ones are the **delfageration index** *(Kst)*, and **maximum pressure** *(Pmax)*

## The Explosivibilty of a certain chemical is normally classified into five classes based on the Kst index, and the severeness of the exlposion is described by the chemical's Pmax.
